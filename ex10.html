<H1>Better Together</H1>
<hr/>
<H5>There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard<br/>
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart<br/>
Our dreams and they are made out of real things<br/>
Like a shoebox of photographs with sepia-toned loving<br/>
Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart<br/>
Why are we here? And where do we go? And how come it's so hard?<br/>
It's not always easy, and sometimes life can be deceiving<br/>
I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together</H5>
